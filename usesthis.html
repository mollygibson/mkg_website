				<h2>My Setup.</h2>
	<p>I am a strong believer in using the right tools to get a job done. That's why when I stumbled upon <a href="http://usethis.com" target="_blank">The Setup</a>, I couldn't pull myself away. I quickly found a number new tools that have since made my job easier. I am now contributing to the community and posting my setup.

        <ul class="no-list experience-list">
            <li>
                <h4>Who are you, and what do you do?</h4>
		<p>My name is Molly Gibson and I am a <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/compbio/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Computational & Systems Biology</a> graduate student at <a href="http://wustl.edu/" target="_blank">Washington University in St. Louis</a> in <a href="http://dantaslab.wustl.edu" target="_blank">Gautam Dantas' Lab</a>. I wear many different hats as a computational and bench scientist: I research, I code, I write, I tinker, I organize, I tweet, etc.  I am a big multi-tasker and I am always looking for the most useful tools to be as organized and efficient as possible.</p>   
		
            </li>
            <li>
	      <h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>
	      <p>I use a family of Apple products that are all seamlessly synced in every way possible. At both work and home I have a <a href="http://dbbs.wustl.edu/divprograms/compbio/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">27-inch iMac</a>. I like to travel light, yet always have my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookair/" target="_blank">11-inch MacBook Air</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad-air-2/" target="_blank">iPad Air 2</a> in tow. It seems redudant, but they are both small, lightweight and serve very different purposes. With my MacBook Air, I have access to all of my data and computing cluster and with my iPad2, I can keep organized and jot notes without the need for any additional notepads. </p>
	      <p>3D-printing is becoming more common in scientific laboratories to print low-cost and customized lab ware. I've therefore recently started dabbling with 3D-printing and bought a <a href="http://wiki.ultimaker.com/Main_Page" target="_blank">Ultimaker</a> for use in lab. It is a fairly reliable, open-hardware 3D-printing option. When shopping around, it had some of the highest ratings in it's price category, however, I've had some problems with plastic jamming. I enjoy tinkering, so it was a good addition to my setup, but might still be in the early stages for widespread use. </p>
	      
            </li>
	    <li>
	      <h4>And what software?</h4>
	      <p>For coding and text editing, I used <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a> in <a href="http://iterm2.com/">iTerm2</a> almost exclusively. This was the setup I used when learning to code and it has worked well, so I haven't seen a need to upgrade/modify these tools (yet). I code mostly in Python now, but I have also coded C++ and Java extensively. I use <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> when coding large software projects with multiple classes and packages. I really want to learn how to use <a href="http://ipython.org/notebook.html" target="_blank">iPython Notebook</a>, but haven't taken the time to get it setup yet. I use <a href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank">R</a> for statistical work and generating pretty graphs and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html" target="_blank">Adobe Illustrator</a> for editing/generating figures.  </p>
	      <p>I keep an electronic lab notebook using a <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki" target="_blank">MediaWiki</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank">MySQL</a> backend. This is one of the most useful setups that I have as a researcher and I can't imagine going back to paper and pen lab notebook.  </p>
	      <p>I use Microsoft Office for most documents and presentations for collaboration purposes (track changes, end note, etc.). If it were up to me, I would write exclusively in <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/" target="_blank">LaTeX</a> and generate all presentations using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)" target="_blank">Beamer</a> class. I use <a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/" target="_blank">TeXShop</a> for previewing and typesetting LaTeX.</p> 
	      <p>For keeping track of the scientific literature, I use <a href="http://www.papersapp.com/papers/" target="_blank">Papers2</a>. It syncs nicely across devices, which will be a continual theme throughout my setup. I also like how it itegrates bibliographies into documents, although again, I use <a href="http://endnote.com/" target="_blank">EndNote</a> for collaboration puposes. I have tried to use <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/" target="_blank">Mendeley</a> For Paper organization as well because of it's easy collaboration tools, however, it doesn't (or at least didn't) have an app for iPad. This is necessary for me, as I try to read most papers electronically.</p>
	      <p>For syncing documents across devices, I use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>. I have a large paid account, which I use as a remote hard disk. This also serves as a constant backup. I use a lot of other Apple apps that sync nicely through iCloud as well, including iCal and Contacts (although Contacts is not really a choice as I am a iPhone user). </p>
	      <p>I'm still learning CAD design for 3D printing purposes, but so far I've been using a combination of <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/autocad-products/" target="_blank">AutoCAD</a> Student Version, which is free and is installed locally, and <a href="http://www.123dapp.com/" target="_blank">AutoDesk123</a>, which is free and can be used in your brower. Design is the biggest bottleneck in 3D printing for me so far, so I'm still looking for the best way to tackle this problem.</p>
	      <p>I often use <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/" target="_blank">Things</a> to keep track of my to-do list, however, I often find post-it note to-do lists creeping back into my routine. As much as I want to use technology and not paper, there is something rewarding about physically crossing items off a list. 
	      <p>To surf the web and communicate with others, Google dominates my setup. I use <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/" target="_blank">Chrome</a> to browse, <a href="
https://mail.google.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a> for email, Google chat for messaging, and <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google Hangout</a> for voice/conference calls (which I prefer over <a href="http://www.skype.com/en/" target="_blank">Skype</a>, but find myself using that many times as well).</p>
	      <p>For notetaking, I use <a href="http://www.gingerlabs.com/cont/notability.php" target="_blank">Notability</a> on my iPad and <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a> on my computer. It would be really nice if Notability could interface and automatically send notes to Evernote. I've seen talk in forums about this, hopefully it is in the works.</p>
	      <p>Other miscellaneous tools that I use include <a href="https://agilebits.com/onepassword" target="_blank">1Password</a> for password organization, <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a> as an SFTP client, <a href="http://vlc-media-player.en.softonic.com/mac" target="_blank">VLC</a> for media player, <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/for-music/" target="_blank">Spotify</a> for music, and <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper</a> for running. </p>
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      <h4>What would be your dream setup?</h4>
	      <p>I am pretty content with my hardware setup, however, in an ideal world, I would alter how I perform computational work slightly. Specifically, I would like to use tools that help me improve  commenting and version control. Two tools that I want to start integrating into my setup soon in that respect include GitHub and IPython Notebook. I would also like a more reliable 3D printer, but I guess I'm getting picky now. </p>
